# testing

we want a framework that is:
 - modular
   - reusable test steps and assertions
 - easy to use
   - both for test run and implementation
 - robust
   - maintainable
 - flexible
   - works for any System

we need to have also good reporting and the possibility of accessing results historic and extracting conclusions from data
